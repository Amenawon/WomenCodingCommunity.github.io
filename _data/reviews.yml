      feedback: Rasim was available anytime I had a concern via slack. We decided to build my app using scrum methodology and I was giving him the feedback every morning on slack. If I had some blockers or couldnâ€™t solve an issue, he had guided me towards how to solve this or where I can find the answer. Rasim was the best mentor I could have, his expertise and experience helped me think better and plan when building something, what to expect in a tech interview, what strategies to adopt when applying for jobs. Also, helped a lot with the CV. He was always available to chat on slack for any issues I had. I am very grateful for having him as my mentor!!!

      feedback: I booked this session with him to get his opinions on an application I was preparing for because he had experience with it. He was able to share examples from his own experience to further guide me, he also suggested some tips to keep in mind and shared some resources to explore. I'm glad I had the session and I look forward to booking more sessions to continue to seek his advice.
