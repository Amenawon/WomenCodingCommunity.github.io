      feedback: Rasim was available anytime I had a concern via slack. We decided to build my app using scrum methodology and I was giving him the feedback every morning on slack. If I had some blockers or couldnâ€™t solve an issue, he had guided me towards how to solve this or where I can find the answer. Rasim was the best mentor I could have, his expertise and experience helped me think better and plan when building something, what to expect in a tech interview, what strategies to adopt when applying for jobs. Also, helped a lot with the CV. He was always available to chat on slack for any issues I had. I am very grateful for having him as my mentor!!!
