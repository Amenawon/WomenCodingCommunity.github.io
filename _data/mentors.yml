  bio: Hi! My name is Min, I’m a kiwi, and I am a senior Machine Learning / Full-stack Software Engineer of 7 years experience who has worked in a wide range of work environments including a FAANG, a Unicorn, a small startup, and most recently my own startup. From my experience, I’ve seen time and time again how the skewed gender ratio in tech negatively impacts everything we do in tech, and what we build. To combat this, I have mentored with WomenWhoCode before, and I have taught a few courses with CodeFirstGirls before. I would like to continue supporting more women to get into tech industry and moreover succeed in the industry until we have truly achieved gender equality and equity in the tech industry.
